# hytale-pterodactyl-egg
Hytale server egg for pterodactyl / pelican panel

## The egg
Since it is quite early, this egg comes with a few limitations:
- To avoid having the updater re-downloading the game on each start, to update the game you have to tick the "Allow Update" variable on the startup tab
- ~~For the server to be used, you need to authenticate though `/auth login device` on each restart~~ **FIXED** [Update wings](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/upgrading.html) to version 1.12.1 or more.

## Known issues
- Updates aren't applied automatically
